# Bayesian-Image-Super-Resolution

## Overview
Bayesian super-resolution is a technique used to enhance the resolution of images by incorporating Bayesian inference principles. This repository contains the implementation of a Bayesian super-resolution algorithm using PyTorch propsoed by Tipping et al in  [this paper]([link_to_paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2002/file/88bfcf02e7f554f9e9ea350b699bc6a7-Paper.pdf) .

## Features
- Generates high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs.
- Utilizes Bayesian inference to incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty estimation.
- Supports various image transformation and optimization techniques.
- Includes utilities for image preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. set the correct path of the High resolution image
4. Run the notebook
